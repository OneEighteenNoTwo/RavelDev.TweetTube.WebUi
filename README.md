# RavelDev.TweetTube.WebUi
Hey :) This is a simple React JS app that interfaces with the Twitter API to display tweets containing media. It's built against a .NET Core Web API and utilizes 
Twitter's 3 Legged OAuth authentication to allow users to see a collection of various media they have liked on Twitter. 

You can see a live version hosted @ https://tweets.postmeta.org
